## first post: the beginning

*motivations, inclinations, and general hunches about just* where *to go*

### behind-the-scenes progeny
    I'll leave my personal enthusiasms for pursuing Acker till the end of this journey lest I embarass myself and make my personal attachment official (which would suck in the unfortunate case it fails entirely), and instead get right into my current thoughts on the project.

I've been at work whittling down direction and methodologies for about a week now. The beginnings of my thought process stemmed from an orientation that has proved fruitful to me in the past. In my notebook I wrote:
    
><sub>Investigate a claim.</sub>  
<sub>subversive anti-estab punk radical ~~femi~~</sub>     
<sub>Feminist guerrilla warfare.</sub>      
<sub>Want to try and quantify.</sub>
    
I knew I wanted to use DH tools in my process (why? you might ask), and my first thought was a pretty direct gouging of Acker's texts for traces of that '[f]eminist guerrilla warfare' and textual piracy which has kinda become associated with Acker's whole operation. I had a rough outline of how I could do it, which looked something like:

1. Compile bibliography matching Acker's texts with various known sources (*Great Expectations* with *Great Expectations*, *duh*. Or *Blood and Guts* with *The Scarlett Letter*, etc.)
2. Use varying levels (like levels of zoom on a microscope) of data and statistical analysis to identify points of difference and points of similarity. Basically an academically glorified plagiarism checker <sub>(maybe the uni can just let me use Turnitin??)</sub>.
3. Extrapolate the *why's*: why certain sections are defaced or preserved more than others, which characters, authors, genres, genders, etc. From statistics come directions for close reading.
	
On the surface this seemed appealing and quite fun; I'd be like an IRS agent tracing crumbs of fraud over masses of data and forming a case, but just cooler of course (my concept of cool has become noticeably convoluted as i near the end of my second year instituionalised @ durham uni). I noticed a significant crack in the plan, however. The Quite glaring was the fact that I was basically just undertaking a fact-checking mission. I wasn't finding any new textual traces (this would require a likely impossible digitised corpus, Acker was known to plagiarise from scrapbooked sources), I was just checking to see if the ones that we knew were there, were in fact there. Sure, working out *to which degree* might add some value, but the resource limitations meant that if I was desperate to work at the level of the words, there would be more fruitful and probing ways to do so without digital tools.
	
### digital acker: a new hope
I returned to my original notebook scribbles and take a fresh look at 'subversive anti-estab punk radical'. I'd been reading Kris Kraus's Acker biography, and the Acker presented there seemed somewhat different to the one off the blurbs of her new editions, to Twitter Acker, *LitHub* Acker, *New Yorker* Acker, even some of Academic Acker. Not only did Kraus's Acker seem *hugely* connected to seemingly *everyone*, institutional (aka establishment) connections seemed particularly central to her beginnings. Acker was privately educated at a New York girls' school, top of her class, her family were quite well-off, went to Brandeis, UC San Diego, and CUNY, flinged with well positioned graduate students, attempted to fling with well positioned professors... So much for 'anti-estab', right?

I had a further conversation with a professor who is both Acker and DH enthusiast, and this just reinforced what I'd been thinking. We both agreed that Acker was a very studied persona, and her privilege and network seemed to go understated and largely unacknowledged (even in the Kraus bio, although Kraus juxtaposes this quite starkly with Acker's squalor living alone in NY, whether purposefuly or not). Was Acker really the 'anti-estab punk radical' she's portrayed to be, creating precarity and grunge aesthetics rather than being born or raised into it? (tbf - Acker became estranged from her family, and supposedly had no financial support from them). 

It looked like I was back on track to '[i]nvestigate a claim', and had a renewed purpose for putting some DH tools to use. My new thinking went like this:

1. Collect as much data as possible:
	- Information about her networks, preferably from primary sources
	- Social media data (twitter, goodreads, anything where someone might have something to say about Acker)
	- Scholarly publication data
	- Articles
	- Google trends data
2. Analyse the data:
	- Sentiment analysis -> mapped onto a time-series scatterplot might reveal changing sentiment
	- Network analysis in Gephi
	- Various graphing
3. Compare Acker evidence vs. Acker sentiment, and Acker sentiment vs. Acker sentiment:
	- Overly-mythologised or what?
	- Institutional connections overstated?
	- Something else?
	- Does Twitter disagree with the scholars (it'd be interesting to see how much of the twitter discourse is scholars for the meta-flavour, too)? Are the scholars in cahoots with big journalism?
5. Return to texts and close(-r) reading:
	- Dig out Acker's autobiographical suggestions and mythologies in her work (i know, big litcrit nono, but acker was unashamedly autobiographical and personal in her writing, even if it didn't necessarily resemble the 'clear reality' of her 'real' life) and compare with evidence. In other words: is Acker to blame for her own (alleged) mythologising? 
	- Potential of interesting perspectives on how circles of people and institutions may have influenced her writing.
6. Reflect

Rollercoaster ride!

### current concerns
Working with data is almost always about following a hunch. The biggest existential threat to a project is the question: "what if there's nothing in the data?"

The good news is: I'm fairly confident that there really *is* something there in Acker's networks. Twitter, on the other hand, is the wild-west and I'm uncertain that there will be meaningful patterns there (maybe my project will be a useful archive anyway if elon tanks the platform).

Some other concerns I have, though I think they can be remedied at this early a stage, are that: a) despite the attempt in step 5, this work strays too far from the literary focus that has been my entire degree so far; b) primary sources may be fairly inaccessible, given that all the acker archives require in-person access, inconveniently in the US; and c), that the heavy lifting required in the backend of this DH approach will not pay off efficiently compared to a traditional approach, not only in practice and result, but also as perceived by whichever professor(s) (or unfortunate postgrad) mark my dissertation.

I'll keep thinking on it...
